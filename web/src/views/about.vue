        <p>My name is Alan Yang. My <a href="https://www.chingyuanyang.com/">personal website</a> has my background.
          I am actively seeking a software engineer permanent full-time job. (Application, Backend and Full-stack).
        </p>
        <p>I am a results-driven professional offering a progressive 4-year career in information
          technology. A former IT Supervisor and Systems Engineer who recently graduated with a Master of Science in
          Computer Science degree. I am highly skilled and well-versed in the use of Java, Python, PHP, and MySQL, as
          evidenced by the creation of several innovative software development projects.</p>

        <p> I developed some personal projects, such as this website - a Knowledge base website that includes E-books,
          categories, user management and statistics report, the front-end framework is Vue 3, the back end is Java
          Spring Boot build on an Nginx web server.The databases are Redis and MySQL.
          Another video sharing website that provides functions for accounts, media organization, social, searching. It
          was constructed with PHP, MySQL, jQuery, Apache, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3 on the Google Cloud server. Also, an
          image Steganography project can encode and decode messages for the images with the least significant bits and
          blind hide algorithm in GPU parallel computing with C++, Cuda and OpenCV. In addition, a project to simulated
          the Blockchain and Bitcoin transactions for different users with OpenSSL and elliptic curve public key by
          Python. Besides, a project to analyze earthquake data to find the closest earthquakes to a location and filter
          with magnitude, name and depth by Java.</p>

        <p> My experience working as a manufacturing execution system engineer at Foxconn has strengthened my system
          issue
          diagnostic skills. My technical skills help address the root cause of the outdated MES system that has
          affected
          day to day operations due to the problems involved in multiple systems and departments. I am persistent in
          finding permanent solutions rather than a temporary fix and cut down the issues by 50%. Furthermore, as an IT
          supervisor to manage projects, I applied the new product process to the system and plant-wide layout changes.
          These accomplishments demonstrate my leadership and communication skills.</p>
